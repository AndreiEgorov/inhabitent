# Inhabitent Theme

A WordPress theme for built as a project to develop better understanding of WP CMS.

For the completion of the project the following technologies were used:

WordPress CMS
PHP
SASS/CSS
JQuery
Git & Github
Gulp

Working on the Inhabitent project helped me dive deeper in WP: work with custom pages, custom taxonomies, menues and plugins and see their practical application. Another interesting part of WP is The Template Hirarchy, that helps understand how various types of posts and pages interact within WP.

Since the project was focused on developing a custom theme, a lot of time was spent on styling. It was a great opportunity to further practice css and learn new styling techniques.

Gulp was used to run tasks such as minification, error chequing.


## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).
