## Personal learnings
Working on the Inhabitent project helped me dive deeper in WP: work with custom pages, custom taxonomies, menues and plugins and see their practical application. Another interesting part of WP is The Template Hirarchy, that helps understand how various types of posts and pages interact within WP.

Since the project was focused on developing a custom theme, a lot of time was spent on styling. It was a great opportunity to further practice css and learn new styling techniques.

Gulp was used to run tasks such as minification, error chequing.
